---BRANCH B---

Vocal recognition with a neural network, real time vocal analysis
and limited efficiency with verified set

----------------------------------------------------------------------

V8 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
50 coefficients instead of 20, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands)
REAL TIME CONTROL FUNCTION, successful on internal test set and in
SOME environmental conditions

V9 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
50 coefficients instead of 20, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands)
REAL TIME CONTROL FUNCTION, successful on internal test set and in
SOME environmental conditions
A quarter of second samples

V10 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
50 coefficients instead of 20, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands)
REAL TIME CONTROL FUNCTION, successful on internal test set and in
SOME environmental conditions
Half of second samples
Non linear frequency evaluation (exponential functions to emphatize differences)

V11 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
ALL COEFFICIENTS INCLUDED, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands)
REAL TIME CONTROL FUNCTION, successful on internal test set and in
SOME environmental conditions
Twentieth of second samples

V12 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
ALL COEFFICIENTS INCLUDED, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands)
REAL TIME CONTROL FUNCTION, successful on internal test set and in
SOME environmental conditions
Tenth of second samples

V13 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
ALL COEFFICIENTS INCLUDED, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands)
REAL TIME CONTROL FUNCTION, successful on internal test set and in
SOME environmental conditions

V14 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
ALL COEFFICIENTS INCLUDED, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands)
REAL TIME CONTROL FUNCTION, successful on internal test set and in
SOME environmental conditions and better results in external testing
Eight of second samples
