---BRANCH A---

Vocal recognition with a neural network, verification on a test set
and behaviour analysis with complete different samples

----------------------------------------------------------------------

V1: No lowpass filter and conversion to mono, successful both in 
external and internal testing.

V2.1: Low pass filter, successful in internal testing but
not with external samples

V2.2: No lowpass filter and noise tresholding and conversion
to mono, successful in internal but not in external testing

V2.3: No lowpass filter and noise treshilding, second type mono
conversion, successful in internal but not in external testing

V2.4 No lowpass filter and noise tresholding (suspended)

V3 Only 2 classes, true or false voice (suspended)

V3.1 Only 2 classes, true or false voice, noise tresholding, mono
conversion, successful in internal and external testing

V4 Only 2 classes, true or false voice, noise tresholding, only low
pass frquencies allowed, mono conversion, 
successful in internal and external testing

V5 Only 2 classes, true or false voice, noise tresholding, only low
pass frquencies allowed (even narrowed bands), mono conversion, 
successful in internal and external testing (warning, treshold got
harder and less evident but is still working)

V6 Only 2 classes, 50 coefficients instead of 20, true or false voice, 
noise tresholding, only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands), successful in internal and external testing (warning, treshold got
harder and less evident but is still working)

V7 Only 2 classes, effective voice tresholding, 
50 coefficients instead of 20, true or false voice,
only low pass frquencies allowed 
(even narrowed bands), successful in internal and external testing
